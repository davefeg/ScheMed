Medical Ontology Schema (ScheMed)
=================================

Dear colleagues,
I am pleased to introduce to you this **healthcare community effort** initiated in June 2013, to enable the use of schema.org not only in indexing health records, web, healthcare documents but also as a **pillar source of medical ontology/vocabulary** for formalization of healthcare information, exchange and interoperability and use in HL7 standards, C-CCD/CDA elements based APIs. This was already tested within SALUS EU FP7 project- with AGFA Healthcare as a partner, and was successful.

This is the comprehensive medical ontology not intended to define or codify a new controlled medical vocabulary, but to integrate all existing vocabularies and terminology (SNOMED, ICD, LOINC, ATC, RxNorm,etc.) in one clinical model using schema.org as pillar source of opensource medical ontology.
The proposal have been already submitted to schema.org and waiting for approval.
The next step will be drafting a set of clinical model using  schema.org as a third-party pillar source of medical ontology which will contribute to the interoperability and re-use in healthcare information exchange.
Do not miss this momentum! Please join this effort today and be part of future healthcare information sharing community!
